## Overview
Monitor and visualize your Kafka clusters with Metamorphosis:
Metamorphosis is a monitoring and visualization tool for your Kafka cluster that allows developers to quickly determine whether new services are functioning correctly. It provides a set of dashboards to inspect each component in the cluster. The tool can be deployed on-premise, so you don't have to rely on expensive cloud solutions.

## Quick Start

Metamorphosis is incredibly easy to incorporate into your application. Let's walk through the steps you'll need to take.

1. Clone this repo (https://github.com/oslabs-beta/Metamorphosis.git) loginBaseOnEnvironments branch. This branch allows you to interact with the app locally without going through OAuth.
2. Cd into Metamorphosis
3. Start the application with npm start
4. Navigate to localhost:8080
5. Within the GUI, navigate to the setting page and enter the location (e.g. port 9092) of your Prometheus Instance

## Viewing your metrics

To view your metrics, you will need to use the Metamorphosis app built in this repo or access our website directly. Follow these instructions.

1. Sign into your account here (metamorphosis-phi.vercel.app).
2. Connect your Prometheus instance by providing its IP address and PORT. This allows Metamorphosis to access the exposed Kafka metrics and send them to our UI.

You're all set! You should be able to track analytics as data moves through your Kafka application, and make vital decisions about your system.
